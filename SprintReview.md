## 🎯 Sprint Goal Review
**What was the main learning objective or goal for this assignment?**  
The main objective was to learn and apply key version control skills using Git and GitLab, as well as build and run a containerized application using Docker Compose.

**Did you achieve this goal? Why or why not?**  
Yes, I achieved this goal. I successfully created and managed branches, closed issues with commit messages, worked with merge requests, and deployed a containerized web app that displayed a confirmation page.

- Reverted a commit using `git revert`  
- Built and ran a Docker container with a success page  
- Generated a Markdown success report  
- Closed all 6 GitLab issues linked to commits

**What deliverables are you most proud of?**  
Successfully reverting a commit and understanding how to manage conflicts and merges gave me a real sense of control over version history. I’m also proud of seeing my containerized success page running in the browser.

## 📚 Key Learnings
**What new concepts, skills, or knowledge did you gain?**  
- How to use `git revert` to preserve history  
- How to resolve merge conflicts  
- How Docker Compose works and how to use environment variables in a container  
- How to properly format Git commit messages to auto-close issues

**What was the most challenging part of this sprint?**  
Handling a merge conflict and getting GitLab to recognize issue-closing commit messages.

**How did you overcome obstacles or roadblocks?**  
I followed error messages carefully, used Git commands like `log` and `status` to investigate. I also reviewed documentation on GitLab issue linking.

## 🔄 Process Reflection
**What worked well in your approach this week?**  
Breaking things down step-by-step and committing often helped. Working in a separate branch kept my main branch clean.

**What would you do differently next time?**  
I would create the `.md` files earlier and keep them updated throughout the sprint instead of at the end. In addition, I would ask for help and not struggle alone because I was up all night trying to figure things out that should have been easier.

**How effectively did you manage your time?**  
- [x] Fairly well - minor delays

## 🤝 Collaboration & Resources
**What resources were most helpful? (online materials, classmates, office hours, lecture, etc.)**  
Online GitLab documentation, Docker’s official site.

**If you worked with others, how did collaboration go?**  
I worked independently.

## 🎯 Looking Forward
**What questions do you still have about this topic?**  
I’d like to better understand CI/CD in GitLab and how Auto DevOps might be used in real projects.

**What would you like to focus on or improve in the next sprint?**  
Improving confidence with command-line Git and learning how to write cleaner commit messages and logs.

**One thing you'll carry forward from this experience:**  
Always commit early and often.
